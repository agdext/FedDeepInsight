## A Privacy-First Federated Learning Architecture for Medical Data

## Abstract
In this research, we investigate and design a standardised Federated Learning (FL) architecture for medical data, addressing the significant gaps identified in the current literature. In our research, there is a particular focus on tabular data, a less explored area compared to image data in FL studies. The proposed architecture comprises several key components, including privacy mechanics, FL algorithms, and model specifications. Each component is meticulously evaluated to ensure optimal performance with a strong emphasis on privacy protection. To address the gap in the underexplored area of tabular data, we investigated traditional and novel methods of leveraging tabular data. Notably, we introduce "FedDeepInsight" an innovative method we devised to transform tabular data into images and then use neural networks for training. This approach has demonstrated the potential to enhance model performance while strengthening data privacy. Furthermore, our extensive research on the key components establishes a blueprint to design a standardised federated learning architecture tailored for medical data.
