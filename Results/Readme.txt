# Contents: Density Matrix & Trustworthiness Score
This folder contains raw data files and a notebook for evaluating dimensionality reduction quality.

## Included Files:
feature_density_matrix_cancer: Raw density matrix data.
feature_density_matrix_stroke: Raw density matrix data.

trustworthiness_scores_cancer: Trustworthiness scores.
trustworthiness_scores_stroke: Trustworthiness scores.

Images of the plots generated

density_map.ipynb: Jupyter notebook to load and plot the above data.
trustowrthynessplot.ipynb: Jupyter notebook to load and plot the above data.

Purpose:
Density matrix shows the spatial distribution of reduced data.

Trustworthiness score measures how well local structures are preserved.

Usage:
Open ipynb files in Jupyter.

Run cells to visualize the metrics.

Ensure required libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib) are installed.
